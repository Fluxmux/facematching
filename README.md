# Face Matching
#### To read my thesis download this [pdf](https://github.com/Fluxmux/master-thesis/blob/master/thesis.pdf)

This repository contains the code for training the convolutional neural network and testing it. In this repository all computations are done on cleartext data. To see the code for the secure face matching algorithm click [here](https://github.com/Fluxmux/securefacematching).

## Notes
Since GitHub doesn't allow uploads of big datasets, the AT&T database of faces must be downloaded manualy. You can find this dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/kasikrit/att-database-of-faces).
